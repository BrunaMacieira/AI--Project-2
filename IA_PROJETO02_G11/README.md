This project was made with Jupyter Notebook. The entire process is documented in the main file, therefore there isn't a pdf file as a report, since the report is already included in the code for a better understanding of the process.

There are some changes that the group would have liked to have done, but there wasn't enough time, like creating new columns or analysing some other relations. Despite that fact, the group thinks that their work is extremely complete and make a positive balance about it.

This project was developed according to the report that the teacher posted and the important marks are all highlighted.
